# IOT_V4_CLIENT_EXAMPLE
This repository contains simple REST - clients implementations showing how timeseries data can be inserted into the [SAP CP IOT Platform](https://help.sap.com/viewer/2f1daa938df84fd090fa2a4da6e4bc05/Cloud/en-US/724057d3064d4553ba198d76636e425b.html).

[This example](https://help.sap.com/viewer/d5f07bf9e1d646959a006f98d4cce321/Cloud/en-US) shows how a simple device can be onboarded and data can be inserted from a client like postman. 

The main requirement for the clients to work is the p12 file that needs to be downloaded for the device. Read through the steps in the above tutorial on how that can be done.


The simple clients are written in:
* [JAVA](https://github.com/vipinvkmenon/IOT_V4_CLIENT_EXAMPLE/tree/master/java/src/com/sample/iot/test/client)
* [Node](https://github.com/vipinvkmenon/IOT_V4_CLIENT_EXAMPLE/tree/master/Nodejs)
* [Python](https://github.com/vipinvkmenon/IOT_V4_CLIENT_EXAMPLE/tree/master/python)

The intent of these samples is just to show how data can be inserted from these clients. Of-course this code is ust a skeleton of data insertion and is pretty straight foreward REST. Further code and logic is needed in order to make a useful application on this.
